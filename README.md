# Dosage

This application (Dosage) is a supplement management and reminder application. Please note that this program is only compatbile with Windows due to the external module wintoast.

This application consists of a main menu, a user authentication system, and the main application where users are able to add supplement entries to a schedule, defining date/time/and other variables. There is a settings page where users can choose to remove certain supplement entries from the 'add supplements' page, and on the home page, a customised tk calendar with a changing date display. A treeview table will also allow users to edit or delete supplements from their schedule. A wintoast notification is binded to each supplement entry to remind users to take their supplement.

Please ensure that all necessary modules are installed
Note that the encryption key is stored in the config folder for simplicity (as this is a school project)
